Real-Time Decision Access:

Users must receive AI-driven decisions from the cloud in real time without any perceptible delays.

Both lightweight (e.g., traffic updates) and heavyweight (e.g., real-time rerouting) decisions must be processed seamlessly.

Scalability for High User Volume:

The system must support up to 1,000,000 simultaneous users accessing services without interruption.
 
Cloud resources should dynamically allocate capacity to handle peak loads efficiently.

6G Integration for High-Bandwidth Communication:

Leverage 6G networks to ensure ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC).

Ensure end-to-end latency remains within acceptable thresholds, even under high traffic loads.

Load Balancing and Orchestration:

Implement advanced load balancing to distribute requests evenly across edge and cloud infrastructure.

Optimize service orchestration to prioritize mission-critical tasks.

High Availability and Fault Tolerance:

Design for 99.999% uptime with failover mechanisms across cloud regions.

Critical services must have redundancy to ensure uninterrupted operation during outages.

Context-Aware AI Agents:

AI agents must dynamically adjust workflows based on real-time context (e.g., road conditions, weather, traffic congestion).

Maintain continuous learning to adapt to new scenarios efficiently.

Data Security and Privacy:

Ensure secure data transmission using encryption protocols.

Protect user and vehicle data from unauthorized access.

Interoperability with Smart City Systems:

Seamlessly integrate with existing smart city infrastructure, including traffic lights, RSUs, and other IoT devices.

Support V2X protocols for data sharing across heterogeneous networks.
